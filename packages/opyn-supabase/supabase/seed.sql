	(451, 58, '## How are power perpetuals priced?

Power perpetuals are priced similarly to options. For a power perp paying $S(T)^p$ at some future time $T$, the price at time $t$ is given by:

$$
F^p(t, T) = S(t)^p e^{(p-1)(r + \frac{p \sigma^2}{2} - pq)(T - t)}
$$

where:

* $S(t)$ is the current asset price,
* $p$ is the power,
* $r$ is the interest rate,
* $\sigma$ is the volatility,
* $q$ is the asset yield.

The pricing formula reflects the carry (cost or benefit of holding the position) over time.

	(452, 58, '## How does continuous in-kind funding work in power perpetuals?

Power perpetuals use continuous funding, similar to MakerDAO''s perpetual contracts. The contract mints a unit of the perp, and the debt is calculated as $NF(t) \cdot S(t)^p$, where $NF(t)$ is a normalization factor that accumulates the funding cost. This debt can be repaid at any time by returning the perp or paying the debt value. If the collateral falls below a certain threshold, the contract liquidates to repay the debt.

The normalization factor is constructed as:

$$
NF(t) = \exp \left( \int\_0^t c\_p(t) dt \right)
$$

where $c\_p(t)$ is the continuously compounded funding rate for the perp at time $t$. This ensures that the funding payments maintain the balance between long and short positions.

	(453, 58, '## How is the funding rate of power perpetuals calibrated?

The funding rate for a power perp $p$ is derived by adjusting for the market price, ensuring it aligns with the cost of carry. It can be expressed as:

$$
c\_p(t) = -\frac{1}{f} \log \left( \frac{M\_p(t) / NF(t)}{S(t)^p} \right)
$$

where:

* $M\_p(t)$ is the current market price of the perp,
* $S(t)^p$ is the index price of the asset raised to power $p$,
* $f$ is the funding period.

If the perp trades above or below the index value, a funding payment is made, causing the market price to adjust accordingly. Arbitrage opportunities arise when the funding deviates from the correct rate, allowing traders to profit by trading against the fixed-expiry future.

* Asset price: $100
* 2-perp price: $10008$ (pricing 54% implied volatility)
* 1-day quadratic future price: $10009$ (pricing 57% implied volatility)

A trader buys the perp and shorts the future. After one day:

* New 2-perp price: $10000$

	(456, 58, '## How are 2-perps used to hedge options?

A 2-perp (Squeeth) is ideal for hedging options because of its quadratic exposure, which aligns with the gamma risk (squared price changes) of an option. Options have three main risks:

* **Delta**: Sensitivity to price changes.
* **Gamma**: Sensitivity to squared price changes.
* **Vega**: Sensitivity to volatility changes.

A 2-perp hedges gamma risk, while futures hedge delta risk. By combining these instruments, traders can reduce the risk of holding options, improving liquidity and price discovery in the options market.

	(457, 58, '## How can 2-perps hedge Uniswap LP positions?

Uniswap LP positions exhibit risk that can be decomposed into delta (linear price changes) and gamma (squared price changes). A 2-perp is an effective hedge against gamma risk, often referred to as "impermanent loss." By hedging with a 2-perp, LPs can reduce their exposure to price fluctuations, improving liquidity provision. However, a 0.5-perp (Sqrth) is a more precise hedge for Uniswap LP positions, as it perfectly matches the risk profile of the LP token.

	(469, 62, '### What are the three claims made about perps?

1. **Stablecoins are 0-perps:** Stablecoins can be thought of as a loan against collateral, with a power of 0. This corresponds to minting tokens with collateralized assets, where the funding mechanism helps maintain a stable price peg.

2. **Margined futures are 1-perps:** Futures are essentially perps with a power of 1. The price is proportional to the underlying asset, and funding ensures that the perp price tracks the asset price closely.

3. **Constant product AMMs are like 0.5-perps:** Uniswap''s value for liquidity providers is proportional to the square root of the asset prices. This mirrors the behavior of a perp with a power of 0.5, where funding offsets trading fees.

Both AMMs and perps can be understood as variants of power perpetuals. AMMs like Uniswap track prices similarly to perps with fractional powers, while more traditional futures and stablecoins correspond to powers of 1 and 0, respectively.

	(449, 58, '## What is the power perpetual (power perp) mechanism?

Power perpetuals (power perps) are derivatives that track a power of an asset''s price continuously without an expiry date. They generalize perpetual swaps, providing exposure to various financial products, including futures and options, with continuous funding mechanisms. Power perps are classified by the power they track, such as 1-perp for futures and 2-perp for quadratic exposure. These contracts receive or pay regular funding based on the difference between the perp''s mark price and the theoretical future price, simulating rolling contracts without expiration.

	(450, 58, '## What are the different types of power perpetuals?

Power perpetuals track different powers of the asset price, resulting in various use cases:

* **0-perp**: Tracks $S(t)^0 = 1$, making it equivalent to a stablecoin like DAI, with funding rate close to the interest rate $r$.
* **1-perp**: Tracks $S(t)^1$, representing futures contracts. Funding rates are similar to rolling expiring futures.
* **0.5-perp (Sqrth)**: Tracks the square root $S(t)^{1/2}$ of the price, and is ideal for hedging liquidity pool (LP) positions in AMMs like Uniswap.
* **2-perp (Squeeth)**: Tracks $S(t)^2$, useful as a hedge for options due to its quadratic exposure and similarity to rolling quadratic futures.

	(458, 60, '## What are power perpetuals?

Power perpetuals are a type of derivative that pay a power of an asset''s price without an expiry date, trading similarly to perpetual contracts but based on the power of the price. They can be thought of as perpetual versions of power futures, where the price is continuously updated through a funding mechanism. The valuation of these contracts is derived from a sequence of fixed-expiry power futures priced at regular funding intervals, approaching the price of a single fixed-expiry contract over time if volatility and funding are flat.

	(491, 64, '### What is a variance perpetual?

A variance perpetual generalizes a variance swap by removing the fixed period. It''s constructed using a quadratic perpetual and a short delta hedge rebalanced at each observation period. The perpetual price $M\_t$ determines the net funding based on the difference between $M\_t$ and the squared underlying price:

$$
f\_t = M\_t - S\_t^2
$$

The PnL approximation over $\[0, \Delta t]$ is:

$$
N\_{\text{varp}} \left( \tilde{r\_t}^2 - f\_t \frac{\Delta t}{\tau} - 2\sigma\_t \tau \Delta \sigma \right)

	(493, 64, '### How does a variance perpetual differ from a variance swap?

Key differences between a variance perpetual and a standard variance swap:

* **Gamma**: Constant over the hedging interval $\[t\_{i-1}, t\_i]$.
* **Vega**: Proportional to implied volatility and does not decay to zero, unlike the fixed-expiry swap.
* **Skew sensitivity**: The variance perpetual is less sensitive to skew, as its replicating portfolio has a lower weighting to OTM puts.

	(494, 64, '### Example of variance swap vs. perpetual swap

Consider a 30-day variance swap with:

* $D = 30$ observation days
* $K = 20$ volatility strike
* $N\_{\text{vega}} = 100$
* $A = 365$ (annualization factor)

The variance notional is:

$$
N\_{\text{var}} = \frac{N\_{\text{vega}}}{2K} = 2.5
$$

To match gamma and delta for a variance perpetual with the same funding period:

$$
N\_{\text{varp}} = N\_{\text{var}} \cdot \frac{A}{D} \cdot 100^2 = 304166.66
$$

If the quadratic perpetual prices at 20% implied volatility, the variance swap vega matches as:

$$

The approximate PnL over $\[0, \Delta t]$ from a Taylor expansion is:

$$N\_{\text{varp}}(\tilde{r}\_t^2 - f\_t\frac{\Delta t}{\tau} - 2\sigma\_t\tau\Delta\sigma)$$

Where:

* $N\_{\text{varp}}$ = notional amount of the quadratic perpetual
* $\sigma\_t$ = implied volatility of the quadratic perpetual

	(498, 64, '## How does the variance perpetual differ from a standard variance swap?

* Gamma is constant over the hedging interval $\[t\_{i-1}, t\_i]$.
* Vega remains proportional to implied volatility (it decays in a standard variance swap).
* The variance perpetual has a different ratio of vega to gamma as time progresses.
* It is less affected by skew due to the lower weighting of OTM puts in the replicating portfolio.

	(506, 64, '### How is a variance perpetual constructed?

A **variance perpetual** is constructed using a **quadratic power perpetual** combined with a short delta hedge that is rebalanced at each observation period. The quadratic perpetual trades at a value $M\_t$ and pays or receives net funding based on the difference between this price and the squared underlying asset price:

$$f\_t = M\_t - S\_t^2$$

This setup provides comparable exposure to realized volatility as a fixed expiry variance swap while offering continuous exposure to implied volatility and reduced sensitivity to skew in the option volatility surface.

	(454, 58, '## How do arbitrage opportunities work in power perpetuals?

Arbitrage opportunities in power perpetuals arise when the perp''s market price deviates from the theoretical value implied by the fixed-expiry futures. For example, if the perp is underpriced, a trader can buy the perp and short the fixed-expiry future, making a profit as prices converge. Conversely, if the perp is overpriced, a trader can mint the perp, sell it, and buy the fixed-expiry future. These opportunities ensure the perp''s price remains aligned with the futures market.

	(471, 62, '### How are margined futures like 1-perps?

In a margined future with power 1, the perp price tracks the price of the index asset, such as ETH/USD. For instance, if you mint stableETH with a collateral ratio of 1.5:

$$
\text{Collateral ratio} = \frac{4,500 \times 1}{1 \times 3,000} = 1.5
$$

This allows for price arbitrage to ensure that the perp price stays close to the underlying asset.

	(473, 62, '### How does leverage work in margined perps?

By selling minted perps and reinvesting the proceeds, you can leverage a position. For example, with a collateral ratio of 1.5 and flash loans, you can sell perps, deposit the proceeds as collateral, and mint more perps. This process can be repeated, creating a leveraged short or long position.

	(502, 64, '## Why do variance swaps have higher sensitivity to skew?

Variance swaps have a higher sensitivity to skew because the replicating portfolio has a higher weight to low strike options, causing them to respond more sharply in a crisis when implied volatility, skew, and realized volatility increase together.

	(499, 64, '## What is an example of a 30-day variance swap vs. a perpetual swap?

For a variance swap with:

* Observation days: $D = 30$
* Volatility strike: $K = 20$
* Notional vega: $N\_{\text{vega}} = 100$
* Annualization: $A = 365$

The variance notional is $N\_{\text{var}} = N\_{\text{vega}} / (2K) = 2.5$.

The notional for the perpetual swap is:

$$N\_{\text{varp}} = N\_{\text{var}} \cdot \frac{A}{D} \cdot 100^2 = 304166.66$$

With a 20% implied volatility and a 30-day funding period, the perpetual swap vega is:

$$\text{Vega}\_{\text{varp}} = 304166.66 \cdot 2 \cdot 0.2 \cdot \frac{30}{365} = 100$$

The variance swap and variance perpetual are matched for gamma and delta at the current price.

	(505, 64, '### How does a variance perpetual differ from a variance swap?

A **variance perpetual** generalizes a variance swap by removing the fixed expiration period. While a variance swap has a defined time interval, a variance perpetual continuously tracks the average squared return of an asset without ever expiring. The payoff in each period remains the squared asset return, but the strike adjusts continuously, allowing the swap to persist indefinitely.

	(459, 60, '## How do power perpetuals relate to power futures?

Power perpetuals are continuous versions of power futures, which pay the power of an asset''s price at expiry. For example, a 2-perpetual would pay the square of the asset''s price. While power futures have a fixed expiration date, power perpetuals stay active indefinitely through regular funding payments, allowing for continuous price adjustments. The funding process causes perpetual contracts to mimic a series of short-dated futures as each funding period passes.

	(460, 60, '## What is the role of the funding mechanism in power perpetuals?

The funding mechanism in power perpetuals adjusts the contract''s price regularly to keep it aligned with the asset''s performance. At each funding interval, a payment is made between long and short holders based on the difference between the contract''s mark price and its payout at the funding period. This payment incentivizes the contract to follow the target (index) price over time. The funding ensures that power perpetuals remain closely linked to the asset''s actual value, similar to how rolling short-term futures track an underlying asset.

	(461, 60, '## How are power perpetuals priced under the Black-Scholes framework?

Power perpetuals can be priced using a variation of the Black-Scholes model. Under the risk-neutral measure, the distribution of the asset price $S\_T$ at time $T$ is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution. The price of a power perpetual can be expressed as:

$$
V^p(t, T) = S\_t^p e^{(p-1) \left(r + \frac{p \sigma^2}{2}\right) \tau}
$$

where:

* $S\_t$ is the current asset price,
* $p$ is the power of the contract (e.g., 2 for a 2-perpetual),
* $r$ is the risk-free rate,
* $\sigma$ is the volatility,
* $\tau = T - t$ is the time to funding.

For perpetual contracts, the continuous funding mechanism ensures that the value approximates a series of power futures priced at the funding intervals.

	(462, 60, '## What is the martingale condition in power perpetual pricing?

The martingale condition ensures that the price process under the risk-neutral measure is arbitrage-free. For power perpetuals, the condition is that the ratio of the price of the derivative and a numeraire (such as the underlying asset or a risk-free bond) must have no drift. This is formally written as:

$$
E^\* \left( \frac{D(T,T)}{N\_T} \middle| S\_t \right) = \frac{D(t,T)}{N\_t}
$$

This equation states that the expected value of the derivative divided by the numeraire remains constant, ensuring that the contract''s price is properly discounted for risk.

	(463, 60, '## How does frequent compounding affect power perpetuals?

Frequent compounding in power perpetuals leads to prices that closely mimic fixed-expiry futures. As the number of funding periods $N$ increases, the price of a power perpetual converges to that of a fixed-expiry power future that expires at each funding period. This happens because the frequent funding payments act similarly to the carry in a future contract. The ratio of the power future price to the perpetual price is:

$$
\frac{V^p(t,T)}{V\_\infty(t)} = e^k \left( (N+1) e^{-k/N} - N \right)
$$

For high volatility and short funding periods, the perpetual price is very close to that of a fixed-expiry power future.

	(464, 60, '## How can we replicate the payoff of a power perpetual?

The payoff of a power perpetual can be replicated by decomposing it into simpler financial instruments, such as zero-coupon bonds, forwards, and options. Using a Taylor series expansion, the payoff of a power perpetual can be expressed as a weighted sum of simpler derivatives:

$$
f(S\_t) = \sum\_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(S\_t)}{n!} (\Delta S)^n

This allows us to approximate the perpetual''s exposure to different orders of price movements (delta, gamma, etc.) by constructing a portfolio of lower-order power perpetuals or options.

A 2-perpetual has a payoff that depends on the square of the asset price changes. To hedge the gamma (second-order sensitivity to price changes) of an option, we can use a 2-perpetual. The notional size of the perpetual needed to hedge the option is:

$$
-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}
$$

Additionally, to hedge the option''s delta (first-order sensitivity to price changes), we need to adjust the position in both the 1-perpetual and the 2-perpetual. The notional size of the 1-perpetual is:

$$

* \left( \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2} 2 S\_t + \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} \right)

	(466, 60, '## How is the price of a delta-hedged 2-perpetual calculated?

The payoff of a delta-hedged 2-perpetual is proportional to the squared price change $(\Delta S)^2$, excluding funding costs. The return for holding this position on an asset with price $S\_t^2$ is:

$$
\frac{(\Delta S)^2}{S\_t^2} = r\_t^2
$$

The total payoff over a period $\Delta t$ is adjusted for the funding cost and vega (sensitivity to volatility changes):

$$
r\_t^2 - f\_t \Delta t + 2 T \sigma\_t \Delta \sigma
$$

This is similar to a variance swap, where the return is based on the squared returns of the underlying asset.

	(478, 62, '### How do stablecoins (0-perps) maintain their peg to $1?

Stablecoins use a collateralized structure to maintain a price peg. The price stability is enforced through a funding mechanism, which adjusts based on the difference between the market price (mark) and the index price (target price of $1). If the stablecoin trades above or below $1, arbitrageurs step in to restore the peg by minting or buying stablecoins.

| **Mechanism**                   | **Above $1**                                    | **Below $1**                                     |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

	(479, 62, '### How are margined futures (1-perps) structured?

Margined futures are power perpetuals with $p = 1$, meaning they track the index price linearly. The funding mechanism ensures that the perp price stays close to the actual price of the underlying asset, such as ETH.

| **Power**    | 1 |
|--------------|---|
| **Collateral**| USD |
| **Index**     | ETH |

	(470, 62, '### How does the 0-perp structure apply to stablecoins?

Stablecoins, such as DAI or RAI, are effectively 0-perps. For example, consider a stablecoin minted with ETH collateral:

$$
\text{Collateral ratio} = \frac{(1 \text{ ETH}) \times (3,000)}{2,000 \times 1} = 1.5

	(472, 62, '### How does Uniswap behave like a 0.5-perp?

Uniswap pools follow a constant product formula, where the value of an LP position depends on the square root of the price of the assets:

$$
V = 2 \times (k \times (\text{eth price}))^{0.5}
$$

This mirrors a perp with power 0.5. In this case, the funding rate reflects expected Uniswap fees and balances the price risk between the perpetual and the liquidity pool.

	(475, 62, '### How do higher-order power perps work?

Higher-order perps, such as Squeeth (quadratic perps), provide exposure to higher powers of the index price. This allows for more precise payoffs and can be used in combination with 1-perps and 0-perps to approximate complex functions such as $\sin(x)$, $e^{x^2}$, $\log(x)$, and others.

	(481, 62, '### What are higher-order power perpetuals?

Higher-order power perpetuals involve powers greater than 1, such as Squeeth, which provides exposure to the quadratic component of price risk. These can be combined with other perps (0-perps, 1-perps) to approximate more complex financial payoffs.

| **Perp Type**          | **Power $p$** | **Example**           | **Payoff**                            |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Linear Perp**         | 1              | Margined Futures       | $\text{Price of ETH}$                 |

	(483, 62, '### How do Uniswap pools compare to traditional perps?

Uniswap''s constant product formula makes its liquidity pools behave similarly to fractional power perps. The LP position is equivalent to a 0.5-perp, as its payoff scales with the square root of the asset prices.

	(485, 62, '### How does leverage work in power perpetuals?

Leverage in power perpetuals can be achieved by recursively minting and selling the perpetual. For instance, in a 1-perp (margined futures), selling the minted perp and using the proceeds as collateral allows for increased exposure with less initial capital.

| **Leverage Process**                                                 | **Example**                                  | **Effect**                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Step 1**: Deposit collateral (e.g., $4,500)                        | Mint 1 stableETH                             | Initial exposure = 1 ETH                                  |

	(534, 64, '### What safeguards are in place to maintain the collateral ratio in variance perpetuals?

Variance perpetuals implement several safeguards to ensure the **collateral ratio** remains above one, thereby maintaining the contract''s solvency and financial stability:

1. **Automatic Liquidation**:
   * If the collateral ratio falls below the minimum required threshold, the contract automatically liquidates the collateral.
   * Liquidation involves selling enough perpetuals to reduce the debt and restore the collateral ratio to a safe level.

2. **Margin Calls**:
   * Users may receive margin calls to add more collateral if their collateral ratio approaches the minimum threshold.
   * This proactive measure helps prevent the collateral ratio from dropping below one, avoiding forced liquidation.

3. **Dynamic Collateral Requirements**:
   * Collateral ratios can be dynamically adjusted based on market volatility and other risk factors.
   * Higher volatility periods may necessitate higher collateral ratios to account for increased price fluctuations.

4. **Overcollateralization**:
   * Requiring collateral ratios significantly above one provides a buffer against sudden adverse price movements.
   * Overcollateralization enhances the system''s resilience and reduces the likelihood of liquidation events.

5. **Governance Mechanisms**:
   * Decentralized governance allows the community to adjust collateral ratios and other parameters in response to changing market conditions.
   * This flexibility ensures that the perpetual contracts remain robust and adaptive to evolving financial landscapes.

These safeguards collectively ensure that variance perpetuals remain solvent and that the collateral adequately covers the associated debt, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the financial system.

	(487, 62, '### What''s the role of funding in power perps?

Funding ensures that the price of the perpetual stays close to the target index price. The funding payment is adjusted based on the difference between the perp price and the target index price. In a 1-perp, this means paying or receiving funding depending on whether the perp is trading above or below the underlying asset price.

	(509, 64, '### What are the Greeks of a variance perpetual?

The Greeks of a **variance perpetual** at time $t\_0$ are defined as follows:

| **Greek**          | **Formula**                                                                                                  | **Description**                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vega**           | $\text{Vega}*{\text{varp}} = \frac{\partial V*{t\_0}}{\partial K} = \frac{N\_{\text{varp}}^2 \sigma\_t \tau}{100}$ | Measures the sensitivity of the variance perpetual''s value to changes in the variance strike $K$.             |

| **Feature**                                | **Variance Swap**                                                                                       | **Variance Perpetual**                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gamma Behavior**                        | Gamma decays to zero over the life of the swap                                                          | Gamma remains constant over each hedging interval                                                             |
| **Vega Behavior**                         | Vega decays to zero as the swap approaches expiration                                                   | Vega is maintained at a level proportional to the implied volatility of the variance perpetual              |
| **Exposure to Skew**                       | Higher sensitivity due to greater weighting of out-of-the-money (OTM) puts                              | Lower sensitivity as the replicating portfolio has reduced weighting to OTM puts                             |

	(512, 64, '### What are the differences in sensitivity to skew between variance swaps and variance perpetuals?

**Variance swaps** have a **higher sensitivity to skew** because their replicating portfolios assign greater weight to low strike options. This means that in scenarios where implied volatility, skew, and realized volatility increase together (such as during a market crisis), variance swaps respond more sharply. In contrast, **variance perpetuals** are **less affected by skew** as their replicating portfolios have lower weighting on out-of-the-money (OTM) puts, resulting in more stable exposure to volatility.

	(513, 64, '### How can variance perpetuals be implemented?

There are two primary approaches to implementing **variance perpetuals**:

1. **Direct Implementation with Quadratic Perpetual and Delta Hedge**:
   * **Short a Quadratic Perpetual**: Collateralize with the underlying asset to achieve a delta-neutral position.
   * **Rebalance Regularly**: At each observation period (e.g., daily), rebalance by buying or selling the quadratic perpetual.
   * **Outcome**: This approach mimics a standard fixed expiry variance swap but requires regular trading of the quadratic perpetual, which may face liquidity challenges.

2. **Hybrid Implementation with Quadratic and Linear Perpetuals**:
   * **Hold a Fixed Quantity of Quadratic Perpetuals**: Maintain a constant position in quadratic perpetuals.
   * **Rebalance with Linear Perpetuals**: Use a linear perpetual (e.g., standard perpetual swap) to handle rebalancing.
   * **Outcome**: Reduces the need for frequent trading of quadratic perpetuals by managing rebalances through futures, creating a weighted variance payoff similar to a gamma swap but scaled by the squared asset return.

These approaches leverage the properties of quadratic and linear perpetuals to construct variance perpetuals that offer continuous exposure to variance without the limitations of fixed expiry contracts.

	(468, 62, '### How does a power perpetual short position work?

To create a short position in a power perpetual contract, you lock collateral in a vault and mint (borrow) the power perpetual. You then sell the minted perp to go short. The collateral ratio, given by:

$$
\text{Collateral ratio} = \frac{(\text{collateral quantity}) \times (\text{collateral price})}{(\text{perpetual quantity}) \times (\text{index asset price})^p}

| **Gamma**                                  | Decays to zero over the swap''s life                                                                      | Remains constant over each hedging interval                                                                  |

| **Exposure to Skew**                       | Higher due to greater weighting of out-of-the-money (OTM) puts                                          | Lower due to reduced weighting on OTM puts                                                                    |
| **Response to Market Crises**             | More sharply responds when implied volatility, skew, and realized volatility increase together          | Less sharply responds due to lower sensitivity to skew                                                         |

| **Approach**                                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Direct Implementation**                    | - **Short a Quadratic Perpetual**: Collateralize with the underlying asset to achieve a delta-neutral position.<br>- **Regular Rebalancing**: Buy or sell the quadratic perpetual at each observation period to maintain the desired exposure.<br>- **Pros**: Mimics standard variance swaps.<br>- **Cons**: Requires frequent trading, which may face liquidity issues. |
| **Hybrid Implementation**                    | - **Hold Fixed Quadratic Perpetuals**: Maintain a constant position in quadratic perpetuals.<br>- **Rebalance with Linear Perpetuals**: Use linear perpetuals (e.g., standard perpetual swaps) to handle rebalancing.<br>- **Pros**: Reduces the need for frequent trading of quadratic perpetuals.<br>- **Cons**: Creates a weighted variance payoff similar to a gamma swap, which may have different scaling properties.       |

	(517, 64, '### What is the role of replicating portfolios in variance swaps and variance perpetuals?

**Replicating Portfolios** are theoretical constructs used to mimic the payoff structure of variance swaps and variance perpetuals by holding specific combinations of financial instruments (e.g., options).

| **Swap Type**          | **Replicating Portfolio Formula**                      | **Role**                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Variance Swap**      | $\omega(K) = \frac{2 dK}{K^2}$                     | Replicates the variance swap''s payoff by holding options weighted by $\frac{2 dK}{K^2}$ across different strike prices $K$. |
| **Variance Perpetual** | $\tilde{\omega}(K) = \frac{2 dK}{S\_0^2}$          | Replicates the variance perpetual''s payoff using a quadratic perpetual with weights $\frac{2 dK}{S\_0^2}$.                  |

**Significance**:

* **Variance Swaps**: Higher sensitivity to skew due to greater weighting of low strike options.
* **Variance Perpetuals**: Lower sensitivity to skew with reduced weighting on OTM puts, leading to more stable exposure in volatile markets.

	(518, 64, '### How do funding payments work in variance perpetuals?

In **variance perpetuals**, funding payments are designed to align the perpetual''s price with the target squared asset price. The funding payment $f\_t$ is calculated as the difference between the quadratic perpetual''s price $M\_t$ and the squared asset price $S\_t^2$:

$$f\_t = M\_t - S\_t^2$$

* **If $M\_t > S\_t^2$**: Funding is positive, meaning longs pay shorts. This incentivizes selling the perpetual to bring $M\_t$ down towards $S\_t^2$.
* **If $M\_t < S\_t^2$**: Funding is negative, meaning shorts pay longs. This incentivizes buying the perpetual to drive $M\_t$ up towards $S\_t^2$.

This mechanism ensures that the perpetual''s price remains closely tied to the squared asset price by leveraging arbitrage opportunities.

	(520, 64, '### How does the collateral ratio ensure the safety of perpetual contracts?

The **collateral ratio** is a critical parameter in perpetual contracts that ensures the contract remains solvent and can cover its obligations. It is defined as:

$$\text{Collateral ratio} = \frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Debt}} = \frac{(\text{collateral quantity}) \times (\text{collateral price})}{(\text{perpetual quantity}) \times (\text{index asset price})^p}$$

**Safety Mechanisms**:

* **Maintaining Above One**: The collateral ratio must remain above one to ensure that the value of the collateral exceeds the debt. This provides a buffer against adverse price movements.
* **Liquidation Trigger**: If the collateral ratio falls below one, the contract automatically liquidates the collateral by buying enough perpetuals to close the position, preventing insolvency.
* **Overcollateralization**: By requiring a collateral ratio significantly above one, the system safeguards against sudden market volatility and reduces the risk of liquidation events.

These mechanisms collectively ensure that perpetual contracts remain financially stable and secure, protecting all parties involved.

	(521, 64, '### What are the benefits of using variance perpetuals in DeFi?

**Variance perpetuals** offer several advantages within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem:

1. **Continuous Exposure to Variance**: Unlike fixed expiry variance swaps, variance perpetuals provide ongoing exposure to asset variance without the need for contract renewal.

2. **Comparable to Realized and Implied Volatility**: They offer exposure to both realized volatility (through squared asset returns) and implied volatility, balancing different aspects of market volatility.

3. **Lower Sensitivity to Skew**: Variance perpetuals are less affected by skew in the option volatility surface, resulting in more stable exposure during market stress.

4. **Flexible Implementation**: Can be constructed using quadratic power perpetuals and various hedging strategies, allowing for customizable risk profiles.

5. **Enhanced Risk Management**: The constant gamma and maintained vega levels provide predictable risk metrics, aiding in effective risk management strategies.

6. **Scalability and Interoperability**: Integrates seamlessly with other DeFi instruments and protocols, promoting scalability and interoperability within the financial ecosystem.

**Variance Swap**:

* **Observation Days**: ( D = 30 )
* **Volatility Strike**: ( K = 20 )
* **Notional Vega**: ( N\_{\text{vega}} = 100 )
* **Annualization**: ( A = 365 )
* **Variance Notional**: ( N\_{\text{var}} = \frac{N\_{\text{vega}}}{2K} = 2.5 )

**Variance Perpetual**:

* **Initial Notional**: ( N\_{\text{varp}} = \frac{N\_{\text{var}} A}{D} \times 100^2 = 304166.66 )
* **Implied Volatility**: 20%
* **Funding Period**: 30 days
* **Vega Matching**: ( \text{Vega}\_{\text{varp}} = 304166.66 \times 2 \times 0.2 \times \frac{30}{365} = 100 )

**Conclusion**:
The variance swap and the variance perpetual are matched for gamma and delta at the current price. To closely match the daily returns of a variance swap, the quantity of quadratic perpetuals must be adjusted to ensure that daily dollar gamma aligns between the swaps, as ( N\_{\text{varp}} ) is dependent on the asset price while ( N\_{\text{var}} ) is not.

	(467, 62, '### What is a power perpetual?

A perpetual is a contract that tracks and provides exposure to an index, exchanging regular payments based on the difference between the traded (mark) price and the target index price. A power perpetual extends this by taking the price to a power, so the contract is based on $(\text{index price})^p$, where $p$ is the power.

	(527, 64, '### What is the example of a 30-day variance swap versus a perpetual swap with 30-day funding?

**Variance Swap Example**:

* **Observation Days**: ( D = 30 )
* **Volatility Strike**: ( K = 20 )
* **Notional Vega**: ( N\_{\text{vega}} = 100 )
* **Annualization**: ( A = 365 )
* **Variance Notional**: ( N\_{\text{var}} = \frac{N\_{\text{vega}}}{2K} = 2.5 )

**Variance Perpetual Example**:

* **Initial Notional**: ( N\_{\text{varp}} = \frac{N\_{\text{var}} A}{D} \times 100^2 = 304166.66 )
* **Implied Volatility**: 20%
* **Funding Period**: 30 days
* **Vega Matching**: ( \text{Vega}\_{\text{varp}} = 304166.66 \times 2 \times 0.2 \times \frac{30}{365} = 100 )

**Outcome**:
Both the variance swap and the variance perpetual are aligned in terms of gamma and delta at the current asset price. However, to accurately match the daily returns of the variance swap, adjustments in the quantity of quadratic perpetuals are necessary to ensure that daily dollar gamma remains consistent, as ( N\_{\text{varp}} ) depends on the asset price while ( N\_{\text{var}} ) does not.

Designing a **variance perpetual** involves defining several key components that determine its behavior and risk profile:

| **Component**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Quadratic Perpetual** | Utilizes a quadratic power perpetual as the foundational contract, providing exposure to squared asset returns.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Delta Hedge**         | Implements a short delta hedge that is rebalanced at each observation period to maintain a delta-neutral position.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

	(530, 64, '### How do variance perpetuals provide comparable exposure to realized volatility as variance swaps?

Variance perpetuals provide comparable exposure to realized volatility through the use of quadratic power perpetuals and dynamic delta hedging. By continuously tracking the squared asset returns and adjusting the funding payments based on the difference between the perpetual''s price and the squared asset price, variance perpetuals mimic the payoff structure of fixed expiry variance swaps. This allows them to offer similar sensitivity to realized volatility while maintaining perpetual exposure without the constraints of a fixed contract duration.

	(476, 62, '### What are the key components of a power perpetual?

Power perpetuals consist of three key components:

1. **Collateral asset:** The asset posted as collateral (e.g., ETH, USD).
2. **Index asset:** The asset whose value is being tokenized (e.g., ETH).

	(445, 56, '### What happens if the price does not converge?

For certain combinations of high power and high volatility, the price of power perpetuals may fail to converge. The expression used to calculate the funding rate must satisfy:

$$
\frac{e^{f \left(\frac{p - 1}{2}\right) (2r + pv^2)}}{2} < 1

	(447, 56, '### How does the ETH³ Power Perpetual differ?

The ETH³ power perp is similar but responds to the cube of ETH''s price. If ETH quadruples, the ETH³ perp will increase by 64x. Like other power perpetuals, it trades at a premium due to the embedded optionality.

| **Flexibility in Hedging**           | Can be rebalanced using quadratic and linear perpetuals for more flexible hedging strategies.                   | Requires regular rebalancing aligned with fixed expiry, which may be less flexible.                      |
| **Scalability**                      | More scalable in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments due to perpetual nature and modular implementation. | Limited by fixed contract terms and expiration dates, which may constrain scalability in DeFi settings.   |
| **Reduced Gamma Decay**              | Maintains constant gamma over hedging intervals, ensuring stable sensitivity to price changes.                 | Gamma decays to zero as the contract approaches expiration, reducing sensitivity over time.              |
| **Enhanced Capital Efficiency**      | Utilizes tools like flash swaps and flash loans to optimize capital usage and achieve higher leverage.          | Limited by the need for upfront collateral and fixed exposure parameters.                                |

These advantages make variance perpetuals a more versatile and resilient tool for managing and trading volatility within the DeFi ecosystem.

	(533, 64, '### How do funding rates in variance perpetuals relate to AMM fees?

In **variance perpetuals**, particularly those resembling **quadratic perpetuals**, the **funding rates** are intrinsically linked to the **Automated Market Maker (AMM) fees**. Specifically:

* **Funding Rate Determination**: The funding rate in a variance perpetual is designed to mirror the expected returns from providing liquidity in an AMM like Uniswap. For example, in a simplified scenario with zero interest rates, the equilibrium Uniswap return is:

  \[ \text{Equilibrium Uniswap return} = \frac{\sigma^2}{8} ]

  where ( \sigma^2 ) is the variance of the price returns of the paired assets.

* **Replication by Power Perpetuals**: The variance perpetual''s funding rate is set to replicate this return, ensuring that the perpetual''s funding payments offset the impermanent loss experienced by AMM liquidity providers. This alignment ensures that the perpetual trades below ( \text{price}^2 ) by exactly the expected Uniswap fees.

* **Equilibrium Condition**: The funding rate adjusts to maintain equilibrium between the perpetual''s pricing and the AMM''s fee structure, promoting stability and fairness within the DeFi ecosystem.

This relationship ensures that financial incentives in variance perpetuals are harmonized with those in AMMs, fostering a balanced and integrated DeFi environment.

**Variance perpetuals** enhance the scalability of DeFi products through the following mechanisms:

1. **Unified Framework**:
   * By representing different DeFi primitives (e.g., variance swaps, perpetuals) within a single framework, variance perpetuals simplify the integration and scaling of diverse financial instruments.

2. **Interoperability**:
   * A standardized structure allows for seamless interaction between various DeFi protocols and platforms, facilitating the creation of more complex and interconnected financial products.

3. **Flexible Portfolio Construction**:
   * Variance perpetuals enable the construction of diversified portfolios by combining multiple perpetuals with different power values, allowing for tailored exposure and risk profiles.

4. **Capital Efficiency**:
   * Utilizing tools like flash swaps and flash loans, variance perpetuals optimize capital usage, enabling higher leverage and reducing collateral requirements. This increases the efficiency and scalability of financial operations within DeFi.

5. **Automated Risk Management**:
   * Constant gamma and maintained vega levels provide predictable risk metrics, simplifying the management of large-scale financial positions and enhancing the scalability of risk management strategies.

6. **Modular Implementation**:

	(441, 56, '### What is a Power Perpetual?

A power perpetual is a derivative linked to a power of the price of an underlying asset, often ETH. If the underlying asset''s price increases, the power perp''s value increases at an accelerated rate. For example, if ETH doubles in price, an ETH² power perp increases by 4x. This asymmetric upside is balanced by a premium yield paid by those who are long to those who are short the perpetual.

	(443, 56, '### What is the mechanism behind Power Perpetuals?

Power perpetuals use funding fees, often referred to as premium yields. Longs pay this fee to shorts based on the difference between the market price of the perpetual and the p-th power of the price of the underlying. For instance, in an ETH² perp, longs would pay $(\text{MARK} - \text{ETH}^2)$.

	(444, 56, '### How is the price of a Power Perpetual determined?

Pricing a power perpetual involves Black-Scholes assumptions and summing the value of a portfolio of expiring power derivatives. The price of a power perpetual for a power $p$ can be expressed as:

$$
S^p \frac {1} {2e^{-f \left(\frac{p - 1}{2}\right) (2r + pv^2)} - 1}

	(446, 56, '### Can you explain the ETH² Power Perpetual?

The ETH² power perp has a payoff based on the square of ETH''s price. Under Black-Scholes assumptions, its price is given by:

$$
S^2 \frac{1}{2e^{-f(r + v^2)} - 1}
$$

If ETH quadruples in price, this power perpetual will 16x, offering constant gamma and optionality regardless of ETH''s price. The term "squeeth" refers to this squared ETH power perp.

**Variance perpetuals** facilitate the creation of innovative financial products in DeFi through their flexible and modular design:

1. **Customizable Exposure**:
   * The ability to adjust the power parameter ( p ) allows for tailored exposure to different aspects of asset volatility, enabling the creation of bespoke financial instruments.

2. **Portfolio Diversification**:
   * By combining multiple variance perpetuals with varying power values, users can construct diversified portfolios that mimic complex payoff structures found in traditional finance.

3. **Advanced Risk Management**:
   * Variance perpetuals enable sophisticated risk management strategies, such as hedging against specific types of volatility or constructing leveraged positions, enhancing the versatility of financial products.

4. **Interoperability with Other DeFi Instruments**:
   * Variance perpetuals can integrate seamlessly with other DeFi protocols (e.g., AMMs, lending platforms), fostering the development of interconnected and innovative financial ecosystems.

5. **Scalable Design**:
   * The unified framework of variance perpetuals supports the scalable development of new financial products without the need for extensive foundational changes, promoting rapid innovation.

6. **Enhanced Capital Efficiency**:
   * Leveraging tools like flash swaps and flash loans allows for more efficient capital utilization, enabling the creation of high-leverage and capital-efficient financial products.

	(489, 64, '### What is a variance swap?

A variance swap is an exchange of future price variance for a fixed swap rate. The payoff over a time interval $\[0,T]$ is:

$$
V\_T = N\_{\text{var}} \left( s^2\_{\[0,T]} - K^2 \right)
$$

where:

* $N\_{\text{var}}$ = variance notional
* $s^2\_{\[0,T]}$ = measured variance over $\[0,T]$
* $K$ = strike in volatility units

Variance is measured from $n+1$ observations of the price $S\_{t\_0}, S\_{t\_1}, \ldots, S\_{t\_n}$ with:

$$
s^2\_{\[0,T]} = 100^2 \frac{A}{D} \sum\_{i=1}^{N} r\_i^2

At time $t\_0$, the Greeks are:

* **Vega**:
  $$
  \frac{\partial V\_{t\_0}}{\partial K} = N\_{\text{var}} \cdot 2K
  $$

* **Intraday Delta**:
  $$
  \frac{\partial V\_{t\_0}}{\partial S\_t} = N\_{\text{var}} \cdot \frac{A}{D} \cdot 2 \left( \frac{\ln S\_t - \ln S\_{t\_0}}{S\_t} \right) \cdot 100^2
  $$

* **Intraday Gamma**:
  $$

At time $t\_0$, the Greeks are:

* **Vega**:
  $$
  \frac{\partial V\_{t\_0}}{\partial K} = N\_{\text{varp}} \cdot 2 \sigma\_t \cdot \frac{\tau}{100}
  $$

* **Intraday Delta**:
  $$
  \frac{\partial V\_{t\_0}}{\partial S\_t} = N\_{\text{varp}} \left( \frac{2 S\_t}{S\_{t\_0}^2} - \frac{2}{S\_{t\_0}} \right)
  $$

* **Intraday Gamma**:
  $$

* **Variance swap portfolio**:
  $$
  \omega(K) = \frac{2 dK}{K^2}
  $$
* **Quadratic perpetual portfolio**:
  $$
  \tilde{\omega}(K) = \frac{2 dK}{S\_0^2}

	(503, 64, '## What are two approaches for implementing variance perpetuals?

1. **Short quadratic perpetual with rebalancing**: Rebalance by trading the quadratic perpetual with the underlying to maintain delta neutrality. This requires regular trading, akin to a fixed expiry variance swap.

2. **Hold fixed quadratic, rebalance with linear perpetual**: Hold a fixed quantity of the quadratic perpetual and rebalance with futures. This requires only trading the quadratic once, with daily variance scaled by the squared asset return, similar to a gamma swap.

	(519, 64, '### What is the significance of gamma being constant in variance perpetuals?

In **variance perpetuals**, having a **constant gamma** over each hedging interval ensures that the sensitivity of the Delta to changes in the underlying asset price remains stable. This contrasts with variance swaps, where gamma decays to zero as the swap approaches expiration. A constant gamma in variance perpetuals provides consistent risk exposure and simplifies the hedging process, enhancing the perpetual''s reliability and predictability in managing variance exposure.

A **variance swap** is a forward contract that allows parties to exchange the future realized variance of an asset''s returns for a predetermined fixed variance strike. Specifically, it involves the exchange of the unknown future price variance of an asset over a fixed period against a fixed swap rate.

The Greeks of a **variance swap** at time $t\_0$ are defined as follows:

| **Greek**          | **Formula**                                                                                                  | **Description**                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vega**           | $\text{Vega} = \frac{\partial V\_{t\_0}}{\partial K} = \frac{N\_{\text{var}}}{2K}$                         | Measures the sensitivity of the variance swap''s value to changes in the variance strike $K$.                |

	(514, 64, '### What is an example comparison between a 30-day variance swap and a perpetual swap with 30-day funding?

**Scenario**:

* **Variance Swap**:
  * **Observation Days**: $D = 30$
  * **Volatility Strike**: $K = 20$
  * **Notional Vega**: $N\_{\text{vega}} = 100$
  * **Annualization**: $A = 365$
  * **Variance Notional**: $N\_{\text{var}} = \frac{N\_{\text{vega}}}{2K} = 2.5$

* **Variance Perpetual**:
  * **Initial Notional**: $N\_{\text{varp}} = \frac{N\_{\text{var}} A}{D} \times 100^2 = 304166.66$
  * **Implied Volatility**: 20%
  * **Funding Period**: 30 days
  * **Vega Matching**: $\text{Vega}\_{\text{varp}} = 304166.66 \times 2 \times 0.2 \times \frac{30}{365} = 100$

**Conclusion**:
The variance swap and the variance perpetual are matched for gamma and delta at the current price. To closely match the daily returns of a variance swap, the quantity of quadratic perpetuals must be adjusted to ensure that daily dollar gamma aligns between the swaps, as $N\_{\text{varp}}$ is dependent on the asset price while $N\_{\text{var}}$ is not.
